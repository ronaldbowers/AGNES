# Another Generalized Network-distributable Entity-based Simulation (AGNES)

**AGNES** is a simple framework for constructing simulations. It enables dynamic adddition of features to individual entities and group hierarchies.

## Motivation

**AGNES** is a newly constructed system based on my professional experiences. It might or might not be useful. My intention in devloping it is to use it to explore various problem spaces, play with modern Java, and to improve my skills.

## Vision

Some of the features to be implemented in **AGNES** include:

- Individual entities and groups
- Models
  
  - Simple Models
  - Handlers
  - Agents

- Model Dependency injection and resolution
- Model Versioning
- Java modules with layer support
- Dimensioned values (Quantities)
- Concurrent evaluation of entity state
- Repeatable stochastic execution
- User-defined state graphs
- Telemetry recording
- External process support

    
I have implemented systems with various combinations of these features previously.
